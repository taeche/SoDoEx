An easy to use location management system that enables users to search for nearby physical stores.

== Description ==

WP Store Locator is a powerful and easy to use location management system. 
You can customize the appearance of the map, and provide custom labels for entry fields. 
Users can filter the results by radius, and see driving directions to the nearby stores in 
the language that is set in the admin panel. 

= Features include: =

* Manage an unlimited numbers of stores.
* Provide extra details for stores like the phone, fax, email, url, description and opening hours. There are filters available that allow you add [custom](http://wpstorelocator.co/document/add-custom-meta-data-to-store-locations/) meta data.
* Support for custom [map styles](http://www.mapstylr.com/).
* Choose from nine retina ready marker icons.
* Show the driving distances in either km or miles.
* Shortcodes that enable you to add individual opening hours, addresses or just a map with a single marker to any page.
* Compatible with multilingual plugins like [WPML](https://wpml.org/plugin/wp-store-locator/) and qTranslate X.
* You can drag the marker in the editor to the exact location on the map.
* Show the search results either underneath the map, or next to it.
* Show Google Maps in different languages, this also influences the language for the driving directions.
* Show the driving directions to the stores.
* Customize the max results and search radius values that users can select.
* Users can filter the returned results by radius, max results or category.
* Supports [marker clusters](https://developers.google.com/maps/articles/toomanymarkers?hl=en#markerclusterer).
* Customize map settings like the terrain type, location of the map controls and the default zoom level.
* Use the Geolocation API to find the current location of the user and show nearby stores.
* Developer friendly code. It uses custom post types and includes almost 30 different [filters](http://wpstorelocator.co/documentation/filters/) that help you change the look and feel of the store locator.

* Enable users to search from a sidebar widget for nearby store locations.

= Store Directory =

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-store-locator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add your stores under 'Store Locator' -> Add Store
1. Add the map to a page with this shortcode: [wpsl]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the store locator to a page? =

Add this shortcode [wpsl] to the page where you want to display the store locator.

= The map doesn't display properly. It's either broken in half or doesn't load at all. =

Make sure you have defined a start point for the map under settings -> Map Settings.

= The map doesn't work anymore after installing the latest update =

If you use a caching plugin, or a service like Cloudflare, then make sure to flush the cache.

= Why does it show the location I searched for in the wrong country? =

Some location names exist in more then one country, and Google will guess which one you mean. This can be fixed by setting the correct 'Map Region' on the settings page -> API Settings.

= The store locator doesn't load, it only shows the number 1? =

This is most likely caused by your theme using ajax navigation ( the loading of content without reloading the page ), or a conflict with another plugin. Try to disable the ajax navigation in the theme settings, or deactivate the plugin that enables it to see if that solves the problem.

If you don't use ajax navigation, but do see the number 1 it's probably a conflict with another plugin. Try to disable the plugins one by one to see if one of them is causing a conflict.

If you find a plugin or theme that causes a conflict, please report it on the [support page](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-store-locator).
